profile
=======

Dotfiles, setup scripts, utilities, and so forth.

Overview
---------------------------------

- I keep a clone of this repository (well, my fork of it) at ~/profile.  This is hardwired.  Sorry.


Things you must set up right away
---------------------------------

- .ssh/authorized_keys
   Public keys only; keep private keys out of your dotfiles!

- `grep -rin kelleyk .` and change it all to your name/username/email.

Things you probably want to read over and customize
---------------------------------------------------

- .ssh/config



todo
-------

- Allow locations other than ~/profile

- Unify "trash file" definitions that are scattered in eighty different places.

- Clean up bin/terminal-color-*
